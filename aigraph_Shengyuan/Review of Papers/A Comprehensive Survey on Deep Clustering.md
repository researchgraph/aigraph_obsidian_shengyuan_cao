## Research Objectives
- **Aim 1**: To provide a comprehensive overview of deep clustering, including its definitions, designs, interactions, benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, applications, limitations, challenges, and future research directions.

## Clustering Methods
The paper covers various types of clustering methods such as:
- Classic clustering methods
- Partition-based methods
- Hierarchy-based methods
- Density-based methods
- Generative methods

The focus, however, is on **deep clustering methods**, categorized into:
- Multi-stage deep clustering
- Iterative deep clustering
- Generative deep clustering
- Simultaneous deep clustering

## Evaluation Metrics
Metrics used in evaluating deep clustering:
- Accuracy (ACC)
- Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
- Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)

## Experimental Results
1. **Taxonomy**: Presents the taxonomy of existing deep clustering methods, focusing on the interaction between the representation learning module and the clustering module.
2. **Benchmarking**: Collects benchmark datasets and metrics for evaluation.
3. **Future Directions**: Discusses potential opportunities for future research in deep clustering.

## Conclusions and Issues
- The paper serves as a comprehensive survey on the deep clustering research field.
- It provides a taxonomy of deep clustering methods based on the interaction between the representation learning and clustering modules.
- It also outlines benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, applications, limitations, challenges, and future directions in deep clustering.

### Additional Notes on Metrics
- **ACC**: Measures the average correct classification rate of clustering samples.
- **NMI**: Measures the mutual information between the predicted clustering and the ground truth clustering.
- **ARI**: Measures the similarity between the predicted clustering and the ground truth clustering, adjusted for chance.

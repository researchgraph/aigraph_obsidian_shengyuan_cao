## Research Objectives
- **Aim 1**: To provide a concise description of existing types of clustering approaches.
- **Aim 2**: To survey the fields where clustering analytics has been effectively employed in pattern recognition and knowledge discovery.

## Clustering Methods
The paper discusses a range of clustering methods, including:
- k-means algorithm
- Distributed clustering
- DBSCAN
- k-medoids
- Single linkage hierarchical clustering
- Opti-Grid Clustering
- Cluster labeling
- FCM
- FELICM
- Correlation clustering method

## Evaluation Metrics
- The paper does not offer quantitative indexes for evaluation. The only metric used is the 'Area of application.'

## Experimental Results
1. **Popularity of Algorithms**: The paper highlights the five most commonly used clustering algorithms and their fields of application. Algorithms like k-means and DBSCAN are well-explored, whereas others like Sparse Subspace Clustering Algorithm are still in nascent stages.
2. **Algorithm Versatility**: No single clustering algorithm has been found to dominate all areas of implementation, indicating scope for further research and development.

## Conclusions and Issues
- The paper serves as a comprehensive survey of the various fields where data clustering has been successfully applied.
- The paper is structured into three main sections: 
  1. Categorization of algorithms with key details.
  2. Fields where data clustering has been successfully implemented.
  3. A summary of the points presented in the paper.
  
- The paper serves as an introductory article for readers interested in understanding the real-life applications of clustering algorithms.
